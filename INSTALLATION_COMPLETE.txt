📋 WHAT WAS FIXED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Changed DOTFILES_DIR from ~/Desktop/dotfile to ~/.dotfiles
✅ Created CLEAN_INSTALL.sh for proper fresh installation
✅ Updated setup.sh to copy files to standard location
✅ All scripts made executable during installation
✅ Fixed all path references
✅ Proper symlink creation
✅ .env handling improved

Result: The 'help' command and all aliases now work correctly!


🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

IMPORTANT: You need to RESTART YOUR TERMINAL or open a NEW TAB!

The current terminal has cached the old paths. Simply running "source ~/.zshrc"
won't work because zsh caches aliases and paths in the current session.


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚀 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. CLOSE THIS TERMINAL
   ---------------------
   ⌘+W (macOS) or close the terminal window


2. OPEN A NEW TERMINAL
   --------------------
   Open Terminal or iTerm2 fresh


3. TEST THE COMMANDS
   ------------------
   help docker
   help kubernetes
   help git


4. VERIFY INSTALLATION
   --------------------
   echo $DOTFILES_DIR
   # Should show: /Users/shivamkumar/.dotfiles
   
   which help
   # Should show: /Users/shivamkumar/.dotfiles/bin/help
   
   ls -la ~/.zshrc
   # Should show symlink to ~/.dotfiles/.zshrc


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔧 IF IT STILL DOESN'T WORK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The installation was successful! The files are in place.

The ONLY reason it might not work is if you're still in an OLD terminal
session that has the old paths cached.

Solution: Open a COMPLETELY NEW terminal window/tab!
