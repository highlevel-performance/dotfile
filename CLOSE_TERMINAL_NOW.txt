YOU ARE CURRENTLY IN AN OLD TERMINAL SESSION!

Your current terminal has cached:
  DOTFILES_DIR = ~/Desktop/dotfile  ❌ (OLD PATH)

After fix, it should be:
  DOTFILES_DIR = ~/.dotfiles         ✅ (NEW PATH)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔥 TO FIX - DO THESE EXACT STEPS:

1. On macOS:
   - Press Cmd+Q to QUIT Terminal app completely
   - Or: Terminal → Quit Terminal
   
2. Open Terminal app again (fresh new instance)

3. Test:
   help docker

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

❌ DO NOT DO THIS (it won't work):
   - exec zsh         ← Still same session, won't clear cache
   - source ~/.zshrc  ← Still same session, won't clear cache
   - zsh              ← Subshell, inherits parent environment

✅ ONLY THIS WORKS:
   - Quit Terminal app completely
   - Reopen Terminal app
   - This gives you a FRESH zsh process

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY THIS HAPPENS:

When zsh starts, it:
1. Reads ~/.zshrc
2. Sets DOTFILES_DIR variable
3. Creates aliases
4. CACHES everything in memory

When you run setup.sh:
- ✅ Files are updated on disk
- ✅ Symlinks are recreated
- ❌ YOUR CURRENT TERMINAL still has old values in memory!

Only solution: Start a BRAND NEW terminal process.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

After you open NEW terminal, verify:

  echo $DOTFILES_DIR
  
Should show: /Users/shivamkumar/.dotfiles

If it still shows ~/Desktop/dotfile, something went wrong.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PLEASE CLOSE THIS TERMINAL NOW AND OPEN A NEW ONE! 🚀
